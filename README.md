# PwnedPasswordChecker
### This is the project which tells you whether the password you have entered as command line arguments in your terminal is hacked or not and if hacked it will show you the count that how many times the password is hacked.
### I have used "Have I Been Pwned" website API for this project. You can find the link below: <br />
